# moodle-block_newcourses

General Information

This block allows teachers to display courses enrolled to them (with teacher role). 
if the teacher hasn't been enrolled in any courses, he is informed on the main page by alert (as block).
If the teacher has been enrolled to any course, he can go to page with the list of new courses from alert on the main page.
It is useful because it helps with working in courses by the teacher (who is informed about new courses and won't skip them).

This block looks up the database for teacher enrolments (as teacher role) and checks if teacher viewed these courses.
If not, they will show up in the table.
IMPORTANT: the block is searching that data in 30-day period. Searching over a longer period of time adversely affects the server's performance.
It means that if the teacher has been enrolled over 30 days, it won't be included.
